# **Data cleansing checklist**

This is a data cleaning checklist that can be used as a guide for cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis.

Ensure query names are relevant to the data it contains.

Columns must contain appropriate names.

There should not be any empty fields and errors, go through every column to confirm. Check 'Column Quality', 'Column Distribution' and 'Column Profile' (in Power BI) to view if these issues exist.

Seaerch through each column, through filters, to ensure data is consistent.
